# Info
In this project, we are going to build a web-server based job skillset data visualization. The dataset is from Kaggle (URL: https://www.kaggle.com/code/rayjohnsoncomedy/job-skills/data?select=job_skills.csv) with 1250 records and 7 features. The users would need to input their skillset(s) in order to find the optimal job/title/position by our app. Also, the interactive visualization graphs will be used in this project are as follows:
- Word Cloud
- Pie chart
- Radar Charts
